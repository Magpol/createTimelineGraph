# createTimelineGraph

A graphical tool, written in python, for visualizing temporal data stored in a CSV file.<br/><br/> It allows users to choose a CSV file containing timestamps and generates a dynamic graph that displays the number of entries per time unit.<br/></br>Example output:<br/>![plots](https://github.com/Magpol/createTimelineGraph/assets/34923554/ae98b9b5-fe2e-4f62-b4c9-c76d098f7894)<br/>![bars](https://github.com/Magpol/createTimelineGraph/assets/34923554/2a42b853-2fb9-49e2-b5d7-eb5a24b5f7f3)

 The user can adjust parameters such as bar width, time adjustment in hours, and select the graph type (bars, dots, or plots). Additionally, there is an option to resample the data based on different time intervals (minutes, hours, or days).
